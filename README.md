# Python Core Concepts

What you need to know to get started working with Python

## Approach / What you'll learn
I will approach this webinar a little different. The first thing we'll shortly look at are some more advanced
features that can take you pretty far. Afterwards we'll look at the basics.

I decided to do this both because there's very little time and also because I want give you the chance to fall in love with Python. :)
Finally, the rich and easy-to-get-started-but-easy-to-keep-scaling aspects of Python are a big
reason why the language has been growing in popularity steadily over the past years.

So let's take a quick peek on how convenient and powerful it can be to use Python.
